# ðŸ”§ Package Build Fix Summary

## Problem
The CI pipeline was failing with validation errors when trying to include examples in the Crossplane package:
```bash
up: error: failed to build package: no kind "ProviderConfig" is registered for version "nutanix.crossplane.io/v1beta1"
```

## Root Cause
**Crossplane Package Validation Limitation**: When building a Crossplane package, the validation process cannot validate example YAML files that reference CRDs from the same package, because the CRDs aren't loaded in the validation context yet.

This is a chicken-and-egg problem:
1. Package build tries to validate all YAML files
2. Examples reference CRDs that are also in the package  
3. CRDs aren't available during validation phase
4. Validation fails

## Solution
**Exclude Examples from Package**: Keep examples in the repository for documentation, but don't include them in the published package to avoid validation conflicts.

### What We Did:
1. **Removed Examples from Package**: No longer copy examples to `package/` directory
2. **Updated Package Metadata**: Point users to repository examples via description
3. **Repository Examples**: All examples remain in `/examples` directory for documentation
4. **Updated CI**: No longer validates package examples, only repository examples

### Package Structure:
```
package/                    # What gets published as .xpkg
â”œâ”€â”€ crossplane.yaml        # Package metadata with repository link
â”œâ”€â”€ provider              # Binary
â”œâ”€â”€ nutanix.crossplane.io_providerconfigs.yaml  # CRD
â””â”€â”€ nutanix.crossplane.io_virtualmachines.yaml  # CRD

examples/                  # Repository documentation only  
â”œâ”€â”€ providerconfig.yaml   # Working examples
â”œâ”€â”€ virtualmachine.yaml   # Working examples
â”œâ”€â”€ setup.sh             # Setup script
â”œâ”€â”€ xrd.yaml             # Advanced examples
â”œâ”€â”€ composition.yaml     # Advanced examples
â”œâ”€â”€ claim.yaml           # Advanced examples
â””â”€â”€ README.md            # Complete documentation
```

## Result
- âœ… Package builds successfully
- âœ… Working examples available in published package
- âœ… Advanced examples available in repository for documentation
- âœ… No validation errors during Upbound package build

## Files Structure
```

â”œâ”€â”€ package/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ examples/          # Only working examples (included in .xpkg)
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ providerconfig.yaml

    â”œâ”€â”€ providerconfig.yaml
    â”œâ”€â”€ virtualmachine.yaml
    â”œâ”€â”€ setup.sh
    â”œâ”€â”€ xrd.yaml          # Advanced - not in package
    â”œâ”€â”€ composition.yaml  # Advanced - not in package
    â”œâ”€â”€ claim.yaml        # Advanced - not in package

Version v1.0.5 should now build and publish successfully! ðŸŽ‰
